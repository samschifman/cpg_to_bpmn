# Unlocking Clinical Practice Guidelines with AI

In this repo you will find code that is experimenting with using Knowledge Graphs and AI/LLMs to transform Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) into computable Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN).

You will want to start with `./CPG_to_KG.ipynb` to build the graph. Then `./KG_to_BPM.ipynb` to create the BPMN XML. Remember to create a local `./working/` directory first.
